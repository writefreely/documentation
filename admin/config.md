# Configuring WriteFreely

WriteFreely is configured through an `.ini` file. By default, WriteFreely will look for the configuration file `config.ini` in the current directory. However, you can supply a different file or location by running WriteFreely with the `-c [filename]` flag, for example:

```
writefreely -c /var/lib/writefreely/config.ini
```

## Server

The following fields are valid in the `[server]` section of your configuration file. They affect how the application runs.

## Email

Configure the `[email]` section to enable password resets and other email-based functionality. Today, WriteFreely only supports [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com) as a sending provider.

With both configuration values set, your instance will have the following email-based functionality automatically enabled:

* **Forgot Password functionality**. Users will find a link on the _login_ page that allows them to reset their password via email.
* **Email subscriptions / newsletters**. Blog authors can optionally let readers subscribe to their blog posts via email, and optionally supply an email address where readers can privately reply. Authors will also have access to their subscribers list.
