# Custom Design

Customize the design of your WriteFreely instance by creating a stylesheet at the following location. This will load and apply a default style across all pages on your WriteFreely instance.

```
{static_parent_dir}/static/local/custom.css
```

_Note_: `{static_parent_dir}` is the location set in your configuration file. If none set, it is the same as the root directory where WriteFreely is running.
