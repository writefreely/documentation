# Docker

## Using docker compose

The preferred way to run WriteFreely is by using the provided [docker-compose.yml file](https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely/blob/develop/docker-compose.yml).

The first step to run WriteFreely is to create the configuration file. It can be copied from the WriteFreely repository to the same folder containing the compose file:

```bash
cp config/sample-config.ini config.ini
```

Or it can be generated by using the WriteFreely container:

```bash
touch config.ini
chmod 606 config.ini
docker run --name writefreely --rm --interactive --tty --mount type=bind,source=./config.ini,destination=/go/config.ini,rw,relabel=private docker.io/writeas/writefreely:latest config generate
```

While running, the container will present you with several questions to set up your configuration file. Once it is complete, the configuration file should be present in your current folder and you should change it to make sure the following settings are correct:

```ini
bind = 0.0.0.0
username = writefreely # same as MYSQL_USER in writefreely-db.container
password = writefreelypass # same as MYSQL_PASSWORD in writefreely-db.container
database = writefreelydb # same as MYSQL_DATABASE in writefreely-db.container
hostname = writefreely-db # same as the container service name
single_user = false
open_registration = true
```

Once the changes have been done, you may start the main containers:

```bash
docker compose --project-name writefreely up --detach
```

The MariaDB container should be running, but not WriteFreely yet. You will need to initialize the database using a disposable WriteFreely container connecting to the database:

```bash
docker run --network writefreely_writefreely --name writefreely --rm --interactive --tty --mount type=bind,source=./config.ini,destination=/go/config.ini,rw docker.io/writeas/writefreely:latest db init
```

After that, simply start the WriteFreely container:

```bash
docker start writefreely-web
```

Congratulations, your WriteFreely instance should be running under http://localhost:8080! 🎉

## Using podman compose

The compose file follows best practices for SELinux flags such that it should run correctly under podman compose using the same instructions provided for docker compose.

The main differences here are that the use of Docker Networks is not required except for initializing the database, and you may instead use Kubernetes Pods instead. In other words:

* You don't need to use `networks:` in the compose file
* You can run `podman-compose --project-name writefreely --in-pod 1 up --detach` to raise the containers under a pod
* You can run `podman run --pod pod_writefreely --network writefreely_writefreely --name writefreely --rm --interactive --tty --mount type=bind,source=./config.ini,destination=/go/config.ini,rw docker.io/writeas/writefreely:latest db init` to initialize the database while in a pod

Once your containers are running, you may then generate systemd service files using [podman-generate-systemd](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-generate-systemd.1.html), generate a Kubernetes Deployment using [podman-kube-generate](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-kube-generate.1.html), or even better, use [Podman Quadlets](https://docs.podman.io/en/latest/markdown/podman-systemd.unit.5.html) instead of compose files for easy integration with systemd.
