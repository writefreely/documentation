[WriteFreely](https://writefreely.org) is a beautifully pared-down blogging platform that's simple on the surface, yet powerful underneath.

This repository contains all documentation for running and using WriteFreely.

## Format

All documentation is written in plain text / Markdown. It generates [documentation pages](https://writefreely.org/docs) on WriteFreely.org.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome from everyone, whether that's in the form of new documentation, suggestions for what to include, or any fixes / updates.

## Releases

Documentation on `main` is kept up-to-date with the [writefreely `main` branch](https://github.com/writefreely/writefreely). When a new WriteFreely release is made, the documentation should be up-to-date with it and tagged with a version number that matches the writefreely repo.
